My name is Daniel Tunde Ojediran, a Software Engineer and a User Interface Designer.

My areas of expertise are Android Development, Front End Development and User Interface Design
My affinity for good design has triggered my interest in the field of User Experience to see how best to satisfy people who use the products I have worked on.

So, here is my little space on the humongous web, where I get to showcase my portfolio and blog about products I have built and technologies I have used
Hopefully, you will learn a thing or two.

And if you ever need a Software Engineer or a User Interface Designer, do not hesitate to [contact][mail-contact] me. Time is short, you know. ðŸ˜‰
